# Emacs Setup Code

Download Emacs from https://emacsformacosx.com/

* Place .emacs file in your home directory
* Create a new directory called ~/emacs-lisp, copy "*.el" to the emacs-lisp directory
* Sets the font to "JetBrains Mono" (should download+install it from https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
* If you use go, should manually change the path to your goimports.sh file in .emacs (search for gofmt-command)

Lots of this .emacs file is *very* old (from 20-years ago), but it still seems to work!
